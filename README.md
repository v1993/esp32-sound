# esp32-sound
C++ component for esp-idf which allow playing sound via DAC with mixing. It implements flexible interface for your own sound sources. It is thread-safe, so you can access to mixer from different tasks.

Current version is OK, but release one (v1.0) will change API and include important improvements.

I'll try to write migration guide from 0.2 to 1.0 when it will be released.
